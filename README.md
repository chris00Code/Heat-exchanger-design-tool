# Heat Exchanger Design Project

A project for heat exchanger design. It makes use of the cell method/matrix approach to calculate the resulting temperatures of the heat exchanger. Further information can be seen in [examples/theorie.pdf](examples/theorie.pdf).

## Units systems

Calculations are performed in SI system, and temperature results are provided in K or Â°C. 


## Examples

The use of the class to calculate a heat exchanger and necessary steps to get a result are shown in the example Jupyter notebooks in [examples](examples).

### [`simple_heatexchangers.ipynb`](examples/simple_heatexchangers.ipynb)
This notebook provides examples how to calculate the properties, in particular dimensionless parameters and fluid temperatures, of heat exchangers with predefined characteristics.  

### [`heatexchanger_networks.ipynb`](examples/heatexchanger_networks.ipynb)
The examples show in particular the application for a shell and tube heat exchanger with two fluid flows and without phase transition.
In particular, the use of the classes and functions provided is shown and these can be used to design simple shell-and-tube heat exchangers very quickly.

### [`komplex_heatexchanger_networks.ipynb`](examples/heatexchanger_networks.ipynb)
This notebook shows how to calculate more complex heat transfer networks. This requires the manual provision of structural matrices etc.
