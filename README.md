## Exchanger Library

The `Exchanger` library provides classes for modeling heat exchangers. It consists of the following files and classes:

Represents a cross-flow heat exchanger.

- Methods:
  - `__init__(self, name, hot_fluid, cold_fluid)`: Initializes a cross-flow heat exchanger.
  - `simulate(self, duration)`: Simulates the heat exchange process for the specified duration.

### `matrix_converter.py` File

The `matrix_converter.py` file provides functions for converting data between matrices and other representations. It includes the following functions:

#### `list_to_matrix`
